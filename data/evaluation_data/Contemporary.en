The writing is on the wall.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
You can’t teach an old dog new tricks.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
The early bird catches the worm.
All that glitters is not gold.
A watched pot never boils.
Actions speak louder than words.
Rome wasn’t built in a day.
The best is yet to come.
Live and let live.
You reap what you sow.
If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain.

Keep your chin up.
You can’t win them all.
Good things come to those who wait.
You live and learn.
No pain, no gain.
What goes around comes around.
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
Better safe than sorry.
